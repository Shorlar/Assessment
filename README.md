## Description

This project is an assessment in two parts. First an API that fetches currency rates and simulates a loan repayment value, and a function that compares two different strings if they are of the same characters. Nest framework was used in developing the API and www.exchangerate-api.com provides the needed currency rates. You will need to sign up and get an API KEY in other to use the exchange rate API.
